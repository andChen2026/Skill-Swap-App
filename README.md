# SkillSwap: Redefining How People Learn

***"You teach me guitar, I’ll teach you coding."*** 

SkillSwap is an inclusive, data-driven, peer-to-peer learning platform—connecting people who want to teach and learn directly, especially those underserved by mainstream education platforms.

Whether it’s singing for math, design for public speaking, or coding for cooking, SkillSwap creates a living ecosystem where :sparkles:**people exchange knowledge directly, empower each other, and grow together.**:sparkles:

**It Matters:** In a world where access to education are expensive, SkillSwap unlocks opportunities for anyone. It is a marketplace of learning where value flows both ways.

This isn’t just tutoring. This is education reimagined—social, affordable, and personal.

## Track Focus: Civics and Accessibility

**SkillSwap is built so everyone can join in, including people with disabilities or different learning needs.**

**Fair Matching:** The app helps connect users from similar backgrounds so everyone can both teach and learn.

SkillSwap makes it easy for anyone to share skills and learn—no matter their ability, background, or learning style.

## How It Works: Big Picture

Users create an account, where they include: 
* proficiency skills they are willing to teach
* desire skills they want to learn
* 24-hours weekly availability 

After that, SkillSwap curates for you a personal list of potential matches, where top matches have the best availability overlap with you and ensures the viable swap of desirable skills. 

## Civic & Social Impact

Removes cost barriers—open to anyone, anywhere.

Empowers underserved, neurodiverse, and disabled communities to teach and learn together.

Fosters belonging, confidence, and growth beyond the classroom.

## Why It Matters

Access to quality education is expensive and unequal. Many who want to learn new skills cannot find the right teacher, and many talented individuals never get the chance to share what they know.

SkillSwap changes that—unlocking opportunities for anyone, anywhere, without financial barriers. It’s not just tutoring. It’s education reimagined.
