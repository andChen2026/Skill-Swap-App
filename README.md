# SkillSwap: Redefining How People Learn

***"You teach me guitar, I’ll teach you coding."*** 

This is the spirit of SkillSwap—a platform where users trade tutoring in their areas of strength for learning in the areas they want to grow. 

Whether it’s singing for math, design for public speaking, or coding for cooking, SkillSwap creates a living ecosystem where :sparkles:**people exchange knowledge directly, empower each other, and grow together.**:sparkles:

**It Matters:** In a world where access to education are expensive, SkillSwap unlocks opportunities for anyone. It is a marketplace of learning where value flows both ways.

This isn’t just tutoring. This is education reimagined—social, affordable, and personal. 

## How It Works: Big Picture

Users create an account, where they include: 
* proficiency skills they are willing to teach
* desire skills they want to learn
* 24-hours weekly availability 

After that, SkillSwap curates for you a personal list of potential matches, where top matches have the best availability overlap with you and ensures the viable swap of desirable skills.
