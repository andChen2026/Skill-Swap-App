# SkillSwap: Redefining How People Learn

***"You teach me guitar, I’ll teach you coding."*** 

This is the spirit of SkillSwap—a platform where users trade tutoring in their areas of strength for learning in the areas they want to grow. 

Whether it’s singing for math, design for public speaking, or coding for cooking, SkillSwap creates a living ecosystem where people exchange knowledge directly, empower each other, and grow together.

In a world where access to education are expensive, SkillSwap unlocks opportunities for anyone. It is a marketplace of learning where value flows both ways.

This isn’t just tutoring. This is education reimagined—social, affordable, and personal.
